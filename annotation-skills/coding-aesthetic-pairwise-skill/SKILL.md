# Coding Aesthetic Pairwise Skill

## Goal

Use the bundled training summary and manual rules to complete this specific annotation queue. Prioritize task-specific training rules over generic annotation habits.

Default confirmation policy: ask the user before final questionnaire submission, permission submission, or final annotation submission unless the user explicitly authorizes auto-submit for this queue.

## Required References

Read the relevant reference before working:

- `references/training-summary.md` for video and onboarding conclusions.
- `references/manual-summary.md` for official manual rules.
- `references/quiz-draft.md` when answering or reviewing permission quizzes.
- `references/learned-patterns.md` for user corrections and repeated cases.
- `references/reason-examples.md` for short natural Chinese wording.

## Review Flow

1. Identify whether the current item is a normal annotation task, a returned/rework task, a permission quiz, or an inaccessible page.
2. Do not process returned/rework tasks unless the user explicitly asks.
3. Read the task prompt and extract the core requirement before testing.
4. Open the scene, candidate, or preview link in a separate new Chrome tab/window.
5. Test prompt-named core functions and visible natural controls.
6. Close the test tab/window after testing.
7. Return to the original task page and fill the judgement and reason.
8. Pause before final submission unless this queue has explicit user approval for auto-submit.

## Stable Rules

- Blank, white-screen, black-screen, broken, or unrenderable previews should be marked as waste/abandoned when the platform supports it.
- Prompt-named functions have higher weight than visual similarity.
- Named controls such as sliders, toggles, buttons, drawing tools, generators, counters, and camera controls must visibly or textually change something.
- Good-looking static output does not pass if the named core behavior is missing.
- Reasons should be short, direct, and natural Chinese. Use Chinese commas or pause marks, not slashes, for multiple similar items.

## Quiz Flow

When answering a permission quiz:

1. Use only `training-summary.md`, `manual-summary.md`, and visible quiz/training evidence.
2. Draft each answer with evidence and confidence.
3. Ask the user to confirm before clicking final submit.
4. If feedback reveals a wrong assumption, update `learned-patterns.md`.

## Skill Evolution

When the user corrects a judgement or wording, update `references/learned-patterns.md` or `references/reason-examples.md` with the reusable rule. Keep entries short and general so future labels do not sound copied.
