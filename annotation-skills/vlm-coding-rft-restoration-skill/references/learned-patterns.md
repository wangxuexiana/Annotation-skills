# Learned Patterns

Add reusable user corrections here.

## Starter Guardrails

- Pattern: Full rubric coverage
  Pass/choose condition: The judgement considered every applicable rule family for the item, including prompt fit, layout, element completeness, content accuracy, visual details, hallucination control, broken images, and function checks when functions are part of the task.
  Fail/waste condition: The judgement focused only on the latest user correction or one visible detail while ignoring higher-priority applicable rules.
  Reason style: Keep the reason grounded in the main deciding evidence.

- Pattern: User wording constraints
  Pass/choose condition: The submitted reason follows active punctuation and tone constraints in `user-style.md`.
  Fail/waste condition: The reason uses formal audit language, extra punctuation, or a copied template that conflicts with the user's requested style.
  Reason style: Natural, compact, colloquial Chinese, with comma-only clause breaks when that preference is active.

Format:

- Pattern: <task or situation>
  Pass/choose condition: <what is enough>
  Fail/waste condition: <what is not enough>
  Reason style: <preferred wording>
